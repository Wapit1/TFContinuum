# TFContinuum
# This is a WIP Modpack expect frequent changes and commits
This a collaborative environment for development and is not intended or designed for redistribution  

# Modpack Philosophy:
 - Encourage players to dive into complex automation chains without relying on one block solutions
 - Have a constant increase of complexity as tier progresses, 
both through new dimensions and new anvils requiring progressing in various mods to be made
 - Make TFC gameplay accessible through starter kits saving players from the grindier early game and encouraging team play
 - Avoid mod feature overlaps: Embers does all the metal work, create does all/most the item/fluid transport for exemple
 - Encourage 

Special thanks to the Industrial Evolution team providing a lot of their custom integration works :)
